# The Solar System 

### The Milky Way Galaxy contains more than one-hundred-thousand-million stars, and equally as many planets. And while there are that many planets and stars, creating nearly 3,200 individual systems, only one has known life: *Our Solar System*

Ever since I was a kid, I have loved space, and have sought out everything I could learn about it. One of the most amazing things I remember learning was how unique our solar system truly is, as its easy division into 4 parts made it an easy subject to teach, learn, and absorb, which is what I plan to do now.
