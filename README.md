# The Solar System 

The Milky Way Galaxy contains more than *one-hundred-thousand-million stars*, and equally as many planets. And while there are that many planets and stars, creating nearly 3,200 individual systems, only one has known life: **Our Solar System**

Ever since I was a kid, I have loved space, and have sought out everything I could learn about it. One of the most amazing things I remember learning was how unique our solar system truly is, as its easy division into 4 parts made it an easy subject to teach, learn, and absorb, which is what I plan to do now.
