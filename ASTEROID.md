## What are Planetoids?
Planetoids are any object in the solar system that is not directly classifiable as a planet or a dwarf planet (although some planetoids can be potentially categorized as a dwarf planet). 

The definition of a planetoid has changed throughout history and scientific understanding, and is now used almost exclusively in reference to asteroids. Asteroids are chunks or dust, ice, rock, and minerals that have clumped together much like planets have before, and while they orbit the sun, they often do so in a pack, known as an **asteroid belt**.

## Main Asteroid Belt
The closest asteroid belt to the Sun, simply known as the main asteroid belt, is also the largest, with a current known asteroid count in our solar system is **1,113,527**, with even more we can't count, as it is difficult to track each and every asteroid formed and in rotation.

The Main Asteroid belt primarily lies between Jupiter and Mars, between 2 and 3 astronomical units from our Sun, and acts as a "shield" from any large and potentially dangerous asteroids and coments coming into the inner solar system. 

While visually depicted as close together, space is a large, vast, place, and thus, despite there being millions of asteroids in a belt, the average distance between planetoids in the main asteroid belt is about a million kilometers, or 600,000 miles. 

The largest object in the main asteroid belt was discovered in 1801 by the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi. Known as 1 Ceres, it measures 945 kilometers, or roughly 587 miles, and has been reclassified from an asteroid to a dwarf planet.

Astronemers and other air and space scientist have learned a lot about asteroids and other planetoids in the main belt in the last few decades, and have come to establish that there is a wide age variation in the main asteroid belt, as they have identified the *Veritas Family* of asteroids that is estimated to be 8.3 million years old, while the *Datura Family* is from a collision just 530,000 years ago.

## Outside of the Main Belt
Asteroids, however, don't always stay where they are supposed to, and will often fly off on their own or form new "mini belts" in various orbits. 

One of the most notable smaller belts is known as the *Lagrangians*, also known as the Trojan Asteroids, that are two distinct asteroid clulsters that orbit the sun in the same ring as Jupiter.

Even further beyond, however, lies a seconday major asteroid belt...

## The Kuiper Belt
Set past the boundary of Neptune, the Kuiper Asteroid Belt is the first defense of Earth in the event of an asteroid impact coming from beyond our solar system.

Largely unobserved, little is known about this belt, such as how many asteroids it may contain or how old they are.

Pluto is believed to have originated from this belt, as its orbit interacts with the Kuiper belt directly.

While we have much to explore and learn in regards to the furthest reaches of our solar system and the planetoids it contains, they remain an ever important part of our solar ecosystem and are large reasons our solar system is as unique as it is.
